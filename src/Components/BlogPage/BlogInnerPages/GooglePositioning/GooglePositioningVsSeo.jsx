      <h3>Search Engine Positioning vs. SEO</h3>
      <p>
        While they may seem similar, search engine positioning and SEO have
        unique focuses:
      </p>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={dot} alt="dot" /> SEO is a long-term strategy to enhance
              the entire site, typically taking months to yield significant
              results. It involves keyword research, link building, technical
              SEO, and on-page optimizations.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={dot} alt="dot" /> Search engine positioning is a
              shorter-term approach targeting specific pages. You might optimize
              pages already close to page one, aiming to move them to the top
              with minimal effort.
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p>
        Combining both strategies can yield the best results: SEO lays the
        foundation for site performance, while search engine positioning brings
        page-level improvements that help specific keywords rank faster.
      </p>
