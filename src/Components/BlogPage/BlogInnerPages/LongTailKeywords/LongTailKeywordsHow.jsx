      <h3>How to Find Long-Tail Keywords?</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you understand the power of long-tail keywords, the next step
        is learning how to find them. There are several tools and strategies
        available to help you identify the best long-tail keywords for your
        business.
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Google’s Autocomplete and Related Searches</h6>
        <p>
          One of the easiest ways to find long-tail keywords is to use Google’s
          autocomplete feature. Simply start typing a broad keyword into
          <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google’s search bar</a>, and it
          will automatically suggest longer, more specific search queries based
          on what other users have searched for. This can provide valuable
          insights into what your target audience is looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another great resource is Google’s "related searches" section at the
          bottom of the SERP. After you enter a broad keyword, scroll down to
          see a list of related searches that can inspire long-tail keyword
          ideas.
