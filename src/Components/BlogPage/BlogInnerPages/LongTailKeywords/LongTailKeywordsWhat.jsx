      <h2>What Are Long-Tail Keywords?</h2>
      <p>
        Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific keyword phrases that
        usually consist of three or more words. Unlike broad, single-word
        keywords,

          {" "}
          long-tail keywords focus on niche topics
        </a>
        , products, or services that are more specific to what users are
        actually searching for. For example, instead of targeting the broad
        keyword "shoes," a long-tail keyword would be "comfortable running shoes
        for women."
      </p>
      <p>
        While long-tail keywords have lower search volumes compared to more
        generic terms, they tend to bring in more qualified traffic. Why?
        Because users searching with long-tail phrases are generally further
        along in the decision-making process. They know what they want and are
        more likely to take action—whether that’s making a purchase, signing up
        for a newsletter, or contacting your business.
