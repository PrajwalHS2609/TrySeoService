        On-page SEO, also known as on-site SEO, refers to the practice of
        optimizing individual web pages to rank higher in search engine results
        pages (SERPs) and attract more organic traffic. It involves optimizing
        both the content and HTML source code of a page, making it not only more
        search-engine-friendly but also user-friendly.
