      <h3>Must Follow 20 On-Page SEO Elemets for Website</h3>
      <p>
        On-Page SEO involves optimizing various elements on individual web pages
        to improve their search engine ranking and user experience. Here are
        some of the key On-Page SEO elements:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Title Tag:</h6>
        <p>
          The title tag is the HTML element that defines the title of a web
          page. It is displayed in search engine results and browser tabs. It
          should be concise, relevant to the page content, and include targeted
          keywords.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Meta Description:</h6>
        <p>
          The meta description is a brief summary of the page’s content. It
          appears in search results below the title tag. It should be
          compelling, relevant, and include keywords.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Header Tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.):</h6>
        <p>
          Header tags structure the content on a page, with H1 being the main
          heading and H2, H3, and so on used for subheadings. They help search
          engines understand the content hierarchy and make the page more
          readable for users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. URL Structure:</h6>
        <p>
          A clean and descriptive URL structure is important for both search
          engines and users. Include keywords in the URL and use hyphens to
          separate words.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Keyword Optimization:</h6>
        <p>
          Incorporate relevant keywords naturally throughout the content,
          including in headings, body text, and image alt tags. Avoid keyword
          stuffing, as it can harm your rankings.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 6. Content Quality:</h6>
        <p>

          SEO. Create content that provides value to your target audience and
