      <li>
        <h6>2. On-Page Optimization</h6>
        <p>
          On-page SEO involves optimizing each page of your website for specific
          keywords and improving user experience. Key aspects include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

            </span>
            <p>
              These elements are crucial for click-through rates, as they
              provide the first impression of your website in search results.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}

              <img src={point} alt="point" />
